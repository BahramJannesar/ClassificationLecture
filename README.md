## What is Machine Learning ?

[Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

### How is Alan Turing ?

[Alan Mathison Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

### Imitation Game 

This is the game that you can gusse the person that you talking to is a machine or a human ?

### Classic Machine Learning 

This branch of ML seprated to 2 basely tasks :

 * Supervised Learning
 * Unsupervised Learning
 
### Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

#### Supervised Learning Algorithms 

The most widely used learning algorithms are:

* Support Vector Machines
* linear regression
* logistic regression
* naive Bayes
* linear discriminant analysis
* decision trees
* k-nearest neighbor algorithm
* Neural Networks (Multilayer perceptron)
* Similarity learning

#### Alogrithms are sprated to two brances

* **Classification :** On the other hand, classification algorithms attempt to estimate the mapping function (f) from the input variables (x) to discrete or categorical output variables (y).

* **Regression :** In machine learning, regression algorithms attempt to estimate the mapping function (f) from the input variables (x) to numerical or continuous output variables (y).
