## What is Machine Learning ?

[Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

### How is Alan Turing ?

[Alan Mathison Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

This is the game that you can gusse the person that you talking to is a machine or a human ?

### Classic Machine Learning 

This branch of ML seprated to 2 basely tasks :

 * Supervised Learning
 * Unsupervised Learning
 
### Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

#### Supervised Learning Algorithms 

The most widely used learning algorithms are:

* Support Vector Machines ( Classification )
* linear regression ( Regression )
* logistic regression ( Classification )
* naive Bayes ( Classification )
* linear discriminant analysis
* decision trees ( Classification , Regression )
* k-nearest neighbor algorithm ( Classification )

#### Alogrithms are sprated to two brances

* **Classification :** On the other hand, classification algorithms attempt to estimate the mapping function (f) from the input variables (x) to discrete or categorical output variables (y).

* **Regression :** In machine learning, regression algorithms attempt to estimate the mapping function (f) from the input variables (x) to numerical or continuous output variables (y).

The main difference between them is that the output variable in regression is numerical (or continuous) while that for classification is categorical (or discrete).


#### Today Algorithm is Logistic Regression 

In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc. Each object being detected in the image would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1, with a sum of one.
