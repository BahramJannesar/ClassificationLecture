## What is Machine Learning ?

[Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.

## How is Alan Turing ?

[Alan Mathison Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Classic Machine Learning 

This branch of ML seprated to 2 basely topics :

 * Supervised Learning
 * Unsupervised Learning
